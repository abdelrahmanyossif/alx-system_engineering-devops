Postmortem: The Great Database Connection Pool Apocalypse of 2023 🚨
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: 2 hours, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM UTC on October 10, 2023.

Impact: The web application was as useful as a screen door on a submarine. 100% of users were greeted with HTTP 500 errors and timeouts.

Root Cause: The database connection pool threw a tantrum and decided it was done for the day, thanks to a traffic spike and a misconfigured connection limit.

Timeline
10:00 AM: Monitoring alerts blew up like a popcorn machine. HTTP 500 errors were having a party.

10:05 AM: Engineers discovered the application was ghosting the database. "It’s not you, it’s me," said the app.

10:10 AM: Initial panic: "Did the database server pull a Houdini?" Database team confirmed it was alive and kicking.

10:20 AM: Database team reported, "We’re fine, but your app isn’t calling us back." Suspicious.

10:30 AM: Engineers dug into logs and found the connection pool was exhausted. It was like a nightclub at capacity—no one else was getting in.

10:45 AM: Misleading path: "Maybe it’s a DDoS attack?" Security team investigated and said, "Nope, just bad planning."

11:00 AM: Escalated to platform engineering. "Why is the connection pool so stingy?"

11:30 AM: Root cause identified: The connection pool limit was set to "introvert mode" (50 connections) during an "extrovert traffic spike."

11:45 AM: Connection pool limit increased to 200, and the application was restarted. The nightclub now had more bouncers.

12:00 PM: Service restored. Users rejoiced. Engineers took a nap.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The database connection pool was configured with a maximum of 50 connections. When traffic spiked, the pool said, "I’m out," and left the app hanging.

Resolution: The connection pool limit was increased to 200, and the application was restarted. The database was also tuned to handle more connections without breaking a sweat.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Stop being stingy: Increase the default connection pool limit to 200.

Be prepared for parties: Implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes.

Keep an eye on the bouncers: Add monitoring for connection pool usage.

Stress test the system: Conduct load testing to find breaking points before users do.

TODO List:

Patch the application to increase the connection pool limit.

Build a shiny new dashboard to monitor connection pool usage.

Set up auto-scaling for the application servers.

Schedule load testing to simulate traffic spikes.

Write a postmortem so funny that people actually read it.

This incident taught us that even databases need room to breathe. By addressing these issues, we’re ensuring our application can handle both introverted and extroverted traffic in the future. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go apologize to the database for overworking it. 😅
